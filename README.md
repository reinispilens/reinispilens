### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent economics graduate with strong skills in statistics, econometrics, and programming. My focus is on regression, classification, and timeseries modeling. I have experience working with different linear models and tree models. My proficiency in Python and SQL, as well as software such as SPSS, has enabled me to efficiently manipulate large datasets and carry out complex analyses. I am also proficient with libraries such as sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and many others. 

You can find some of my work on my GitHub portfolio repositories, where I have shared some of my projects and analysis, feel free to check them out and give me feedback.
